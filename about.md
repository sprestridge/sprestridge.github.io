I am a business consultant educated as a civil (BSCE) and structural (MSCE) engineer with further education in finance (MBA). I analyze data, build models and tools, author reports, facilitate meetings, and help drive policy for government clients. I have been focused on capital asset managment, business analysis, cost estimating, and analytics for the past ten years.
