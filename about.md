I am a business consultant educated as a civil (BSCE) and structural (MSCE) engineer with further education in finance (MBA) and data science (various certificates and badges). I analyze data, build teams, models, and tools, author reports, facilitate meetings, and help drive policy for clients. My career has been focused on data analytics and data science, capital asset management, business analysis, cost estimating, and structural engineering.
