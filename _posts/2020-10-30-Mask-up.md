There are fewer COVID-19 cases reported in states with higher rates of mask use.

<!--more-->

I came across this data and wanted the opportunity to practice my Excel visualization skills as well as my Python skills in applying a linear regression model to a data set.

For all 50 states plus the District of Columbia (D.C.), the chart below plots the percentage of state residents who say they wear a mask in public all or most of the time (on the horizontal axis) and the  percentage who say they know someone in their community with virus symptoms (on the vertical axis).

The r-squared of the CovidCast mask and symptom data is 0.73, meaning that **you can predict about 73 percent of the variability in state-level COVID-19 symptom prevalence by knowing how often people wear their masks.**

The above was created quickly in Excel. I also wanted to practice my python and see if I could recreate the analysis in code.

Using `pandas`, I read the CSV data into a dataframe called `mask_up` and assigned the wearing a mask data field to the x-values and the COVID19 symptoms data field to the y-values and ran an ordinary-least-squared (OLS) regression. Once that was done it was easy to calculate the r-squared:

`r2 = r2_score(y, linefitline(x))`

The plot took a bit of experimetnation to get the settings and formats the way that I wanted. I'm still not happy with the `linestyle` but it will do for now. See below.

Wear your masks.
