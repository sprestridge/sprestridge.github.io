Kikkan Randall and Jesse Diggions winning the U.S. women's cross-country medal was one of my favorite moments.

> Diggins crossed the line 0.19 seconds before Nilsson, so close Randall could not be sure who won until she looked at a scoreboard above the grandstand. It showed a “1” next to “United States.”
>
> Diggins could not feel her legs, numb from the frenzied, indelible sprint she had just completed. Randall screamed, ran to Diggins and tackled her.
>
> “Oh my gosh!” Diggins cried. “Did we just win the Olympics?”
>
> “Yeaaahhh!” Randall shouted back.

One of my favorite moments of this PyeongChang Olympics. I recall reading an [article](https://www.outsideonline.com/2159051/kikkan-effect) in Outside magazine about Kikkan Randall, impressive athlete and she sounds like a terrific teammate as well.

> But Randall’s Olympic disappointment still stings. I asked her about it as she was getting her hair re-pinked—a monthly process—and for once I see a crack in her happy demeanor. “It was frustrating,” she says, wiping a tear from her cheek. “I’ll have one more shot in Korea in 2018. Then I’ll retire.”

Now she's beyond the disappointment and frustration and has a gold medal around her neck. Ride of into the sunset victorius, [Kikkanimal](https://www.kikkan.com/about/).
