I am using the 'Outlook on Life' survey data to investigate if age or education play a role in whether people think blacks and other minorities are treated the same as whites in the criminal justice system (W1_K4 in the codebook) or in whether they have trust in the legal system (W1_K1_C in the codebook).

## Do you think that blacks and other minorities are treated the same in the criminal justice system?

ANOVA revealed that there is no significance to the age groups of my analysis (18-29, 20-34, 45-59, and 60+) when looking at the question of whether blacks and minorities are treated the same as whites in the criminal justice system. F (3, 1,994)=0.56, p=0.6408. The null hypothesis is accepted. The means of the age groups are not significantly different according to the Duncan post hoc test.

ANOVA revealed that education level has significance to the answer to this question. F(1, 1,996)=12.35, p=.0001. Post hoc comparisons of the mean revealed that individuals with some college or higher levels of education reported a stronger belief that blacks and other minorities _do not receive_ equal treatment (mean of 5.4 verses a mean of 5.1 for those with high school or lower levels of education). The responses are on a 1 to 7 scale with _1 corresponding to 'receive equal treatment'_ and _7 corresponding to 'do not receive equal treatment'_.


## Do you trust the legal system?

ANOVA revealed that there is significance to the age groups when considering the question of trust in the legal system. F (3, 2,226)=5.15, p=0.0015. The null hypothesis is rejected. Post hoc comparisons of the mean using the Duncan test revealed that _younger people (18-29) are statistically more likely to distrust the legal system (mean 2.8254) than any of the other age groups_ - 30-44 (mean 2.7367), 45-59 (mean 2.7098), and 60+ (mean 2.6540).

Education level is also significant for measuring general trust in the legal system. F (1, 2,228)=24.39, p=.0001. Responses were originally coded as 1-Just about always to 4-Never and were grouped for analysis into Trust (1-Just about always and 2-Most of the time) and Mistrust (3-Only some of the time and 4-Never). The Duncan test post hoc comparisons indicate that _the mean of 2.8068 for trust in the legal system by those with high school or lower levels of education is significantly different than the mean of 2.6595 for those with some college or higher levels of education_.
