## [Which fonts to use for your charts and tables - Datawrapper Blog](https://blog.datawrapper.de/fonts-for-data-visualization/)

I’ve been reading Lisa Charlotte Muth’s writing on [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de) and elsewhere for a while and recently stumbled on [this post](https://blog.datawrapper.de/fonts-for-data-visualization/) again. I like that instead of just listing the top X things you should do for Y, she covers all the tips by explaining why and providing examples of _not ideal_ and _better_ solutions along with plenty of examples from mainstream sites. 

Next time you are working on a presentation with graphs and tables, keep these tips in mind.
