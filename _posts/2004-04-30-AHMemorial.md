From April 23-25, TJ Sokol Radotin hosted the 11th annual international box lacrosse tournament, the HBA Cup-Aleš Hřebeský Memorial. The tourney is annually one of Europe's premier lacrosse events, and had a record number of 12 participants: Rebels (USA), US Team Philadelphia (USA), BLAX (Berlin), VFK Berlin, LC Passau (GER), from abroad, and local teams LC Jizni Mesto (Cz), TJ Malesice, and host club LCC Radotin forming Group 1. Group 2 consisted of LC Kromerice (CZ), LC Pardubice (Cz), Tricksters Bratislava (Slo), and the Mix Team featuring U-19 Czech Team players plus several players from the Vienna Monarchs.

The debut performance of the Slovakian team and the Austrian players is evidence of the growing borders of the game and lacrosse's steady drive to take over the globe. Further evidence of the game's explosion here in Europe is the Euro Championship slated for July 24-31 in Prague, which has twice as many countries participating (18) than the last Euros which were held in Cardiff, Wales just three years ago.

For the third consecutive year, Rebels took home the cup posting an exciting 7-6 win in the semi against TJ Malesice, and outclassing LC Jizni Mesto in a hard fought title match 6-4. Radotin and Malesice share third place, with US Team (Philadelphia), BLAX, VFK, and LC Passau rounding out the order of finish. Perrenial HBA participants LC Pardubice held off the Mix Team to take bragging rights of the second group with LC Kromerice and Tricksters Bratislava rounding out the standings.

The tournament again hit a fever pitch Saturday night starting with the third annual All-Star game held under the lights, pitting the Czech All-Stars against the International All-Stars. Despite a steady rain, 1,500 fans enjoyed a well-played and dramatic game which ended 6-6 and was decided by a shoot out. The Czech Stars prevailed but there were no losers on or off the pitch as all witnessed an awesome fireworks display before heading to the Tournament party.
