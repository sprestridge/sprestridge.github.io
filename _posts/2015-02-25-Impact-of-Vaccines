The WSJ paywall is odd so if that link does not work just Google the article's full title and follow the link from the search results to see the original: ["Battling Infectious Diseases in the 20th Century: The Impact of Vaccines"](https://www.google.com/search?q=Battling+Infectious+Diseases+in+the+20th+Century:+The+Impact+of+Vaccines). The heat maps show the number of cases per 10,000 people measured over 70-some years across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. That is a large amount of data summarized in a compelling fashion.
