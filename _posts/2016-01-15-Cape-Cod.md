<cite>From Salt Marsh | S.L. Prestridge</cite>

For over 20 years my friends and family have been fortunate to vacation on Cape Cod in Eastham, MA. It is a special place and will forever have a hold on my heart and soul. What many do not realize is that much of the outer cape, from Eastham to Provincetown, is part of our national park system: 

>_‚Äùthe best idea we ever had. Absolutely American, absolutely democratic, they reflect us at our best rather than our worst."_
~Wallace Stegner

I think we need a lot more of that in our country right now...our best, rather than our worst.

Enjoy the panoramic that I took on one of our trips in the summer of 2014, from the salt marsh behind Coast Guard beach looking up toward the old station.

Get outside and enjoy the places that move you. Cape Cod National Seashore is one of mine. #findyourpark
