I've seen a lot of tips around the Internet about how to improve prompts. Here's some simple ones that rely on nothing more than some [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

## Use Headers to organize content

- Use # for main headings.
- Use ##, ###, etc., for subheadings.

```markdown
# Main Heading

## Subheading

### Sub-subheading
```

## Emphasize text for clarity

- Use `**text**` for bold.
- Use `*text*` or `_text_` for italic.

```markdown
I am **strongly** emphasizing this.

This is an _important_ note.
```

## Create lists for better readability

- Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists.
- Use 1., 2., etc., for ordered lists

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

```markdown
- First step
- Second step
- Third step
```

## Include reference links

- Use [text](URL) to include a link.

```markdown
Visit [OpenAI](https://openai.com)
```

## Use code blocks for technical content

- Use code blocks that begin and end with triple back ticks \`\`\`.

\```
```python
# This is a code block
print("Hello")
```
\```

And one more example:

```markdown
```Also a code block```
```

But a single line, command, or function can be done with single back ticks:

```markdown
`print("this is a line of code")`
```


## Use block quotes for citations

- Use `>` for block quotes

```markdown
Your quote goes here:

> Now is the time for all good men...
```

## Add images

- Use `![al text](image url)` for images

```markdown
![This is an image](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```
