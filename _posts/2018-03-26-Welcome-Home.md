Apple recently released an ad for the HomePod called [Welcome Home](https://youtu.be/305ryPvU6A8) that is over 4 minutes for the full length spot. I liked it at first but once I watched it a few times and saw this [behind the scenes video](http://www.adweek.com/creativity/metro-germany-fetes-womens-day-by-giving-newborn-babies-an-entrepreneurial-boost/) of the production, I loved it. The ad was directed by Spike Jonze and stars FKA Twigs, music is [_'Til It's Over_ by Anderson .Paak](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/til-its-over/1355644175?i=1355644460).

The whole thing was shot on a moveable set and very little post-production or CGI tricks were employed. Watch the behind the scenes video in the article linked to above. Both the ad and the behind the scenes are definitely worth it in my opinion.
