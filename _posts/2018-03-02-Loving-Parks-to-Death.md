## [CNN Report on Visitor Statistics and Deferred Maintenance (DM)](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/most-popular-national-park-service-sites-2017/index.html)

I often get asked _'how many parks are their in the National Park Service?'_ and I almost always hedge my answer because there are 417 sites but what most people are referring to when they ask the question are the 59 'park' units (think headliner National Parks - if it does not have 'National Park' in the name it is a different kind of unit). Other types of sites or units in the NPS are parkways (Blue Ridge Parkway), recreation areas (Lake Mead National Recreation Area), seashores (Cape Cod National Seashore), battlefields (Gettysburg National Battlefield), and more.

In a recent CNN report on visitation statistics and [deferred maintenance (DM)](https://go.nps.gov/deferredmaint) there was some confusion about the park and unit / site distinction. In the list for popular park sites, two National Parks are included - Great Smoky and Grand Canyon. Below are the two lists from the CNN article. Visitation numbers and DM estimates are included. Deferred Maintenance (DM) is maintenance and repairs of assets that was not performed when it should have been and is delayed to a future period. Across the entire NPS the DM total has reached $11.6 billion. Examining the magnitude of the DM below, it is obvious that "America's best idea" is loved to death. Chronic underfunding, the inability to collect fees at many destinations (only 118 sites charge admission), and aging infrastructure, as well as increased visitation, all contribute to the problem.
