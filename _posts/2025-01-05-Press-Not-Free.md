## Washington Post Cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, quits after paper rejects sketch of Bezos bowing to Trump

First there was Jeff Bezos' decision to block the Washington Post endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris for president, and now this. I already [canceled my subscription](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168416/washington-post-bezos-endorsement-president-cancellations-resignations) but that did not stop the Post from spending the holidays begging me to return with offers of reduced subscription pricing.

Via Ann's blog post on the matter:

> “I’ve worked for the Washington Post since 2008 as an editorial cartoonist. … I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now.”

But sure, [democracy dies in darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Dies_in_Darkness). Ann is at least holding truth to power through her cartooning and decision to quit her job.

I am not linking to the post because it is on [Substack (you know - if it walks like a duck)](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/11/substack-extremism-nazi-white-supremacy-newsletters/676156/), but Ann Telnaes' entire post about the situation follows.

> I've worked for the _Washington Post_ since 2008 as an editorial cartoonist. I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations--and some differences--about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I've never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now.
> 
> The cartoon that was killed criticizes the billionaire tech and media chief executives who have been doing their best to curry favor with incoming President-elect Trump. There have been multiple [articles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/19/trump-bezos-musk-dinner/) recently about these men with lucrative government contracts and an interest in eliminating regulations making their way to Mar-a-lago. The group in the cartoon included Mark Zuckerberg/Facebook & Meta founder and CEO, Sam Altman/AI CEO, Patrick Soon-Shiong/_LA Times _publisher, the Walt Disney Company/ABC News, and Jeff Bezos/_Washington Post_ owner.
> 
> While it isn't uncommon for editorial page editors to object to visual metaphors within a cartoon if it strikes that editor as unclear or isn't correctly conveying the message intended by the cartoonist, such editorial criticism was not the case regarding this cartoon. To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon's commentary. That's a game changer…and dangerous for a free press.

As a member of the [Advisory board](https://freedomcartoonists.com/about/#governance) for the Geneva based [Freedom Cartoonists Foundation ](https://freedomcartoonists.com/)and a former board member of [Cartoonists Rights](https://cartoonistsrights.org/), I believe that editorial cartoonists are vital for civic debate and have an essential role in journalism.

> There will be people who say, "Hey, you work for a company and that company has the right to expect employees to adhere to what's good for the company". That's true except we're talking about news organizations that have public obligations and who are obliged to nurture a free press in a democracy. Owners of such press organizations are responsible for safeguarding that free press-- and trying to get in the good graces of an autocrat-in-waiting will only result in undermining that free press.
> 
> As an editorial cartoonist, my job is to hold powerful people and institutions accountable. For the first time, my editor prevented me from doing that critical job. So I have decided to leave the _Post_. I doubt my decision will cause much of a stir and that it will be dismissed because I'm just a cartoonist. But I will not stop holding truth to power through my cartooning, because as they say, "_Democracy dies in darkness_".
