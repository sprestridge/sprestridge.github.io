If you studied statistics in college you probably learned about Bayes' Theorem which is a useful tool for calculating conditional probabilities but as it is generally stated can be intimidating unless you are a world-class statistician. Legos to the rescue! That's right, everything I know about Bayes' Theorem I learned from Lego bricks and this [blog post](http://goo.gl/ZtuvxJ) which elegantly explains Bayes' Theorem using Legos and also derives the theorem conceptually. Enjoy.

Oh, and always choose the red pill.
