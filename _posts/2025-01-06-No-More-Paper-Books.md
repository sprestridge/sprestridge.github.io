## [Return from the Stars, by Stanislaw Lem - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_from_the_Stars)

[Time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation) fascinated me from a young age, before I even learned about the special theory of relativity or studied physics. I learned about time dilation from the sci-fi books of my youth, like this one.

> Written in 1961, it is the story of a [cosmonaut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmonaut) returning to his homeworld, Earth, after more than a century in Earth time, but just 10 years for him, finding it a completely different place, with many developments he dislikes.

An even more wild thing is the author predicts the disappearance of paper books and describes a reading device like a tablet or an e-ink reader (Kindle) with a single page and successive touches reveal the next page.

Although, I wonder if Stanislaw had seen [2001: A Space Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey) before he wrote the book. Kubrick's screenplay famously shows the astronauts aboard the Discovery One using an IBM Newspad, a device that allows space-faring humans to keep up with the news back home. Samsung famously used this in a patent battle with Apple over the technology behind the iPad, claiming prior art.

Technology predictions aside, imagine being gone only 10-years from your point of view but the home planet you left behind has experienced more than 100-years. 

What wonders would you experience? 

What social norms would you not understand?

> The books were crystals with recorded contents. They could be read with the aid of an opton, which was similar to a book but had only one page between the covers. At a touch, successive pages of the text appeared on it.
