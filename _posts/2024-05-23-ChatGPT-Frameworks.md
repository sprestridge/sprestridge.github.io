Unlock the full potential of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and LLMs. Learn these four simple prompt frameworks to improve the responses from the model.

`R-T-F`: **Role - Task - Format**. Act as a ROLE, Create a TASK, Show as FORMAT.

`T-A-G`: **Task - Action - Goal**. Define the TASK, State the ACTION, Clarify the GOAL.

`B-A-B`: **Before - After - Bridge**. Explain problem BEFORE, State outcome AFTER, ask the BRIDGE.

`C-A-R-E`: **Context - Action - Result** - Example: Give the CONTEXT, Describe the ACTION, Clarify the RESULTS, Give the EXAMPLES.

Eager to use other strategic planning frameworks like SWOT analysis from the business world? That works too.

`S-W-O-T`: **Strengths - Weaknesses - Opportunities - Threats**: Analyze STRENGTHS, acknowledge WEAKNESSES, explore and consider OPPORTUNITIES, and consider THREATS.

How do these frameworks work for you? Others to share?
