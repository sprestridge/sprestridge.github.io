### [NLL Notebook: Rush Sweep, Del Bianco Shines and Byrne Breaks Loose | US Lacrosse Magazine](https://www.uslaxmagazine.com/pro/nll/nll-notebook-rush-sweep-del-bianco-shines-and-byrne-breaks-loose)

> SPORTSMANLIKE SCHREIBER
>
> Tom Schreiber puts up impressive scoring stats, but one of the most impressive entries on his ledger is zero, as in zero penalty minutes. He’s now played 28 NLL games, including playoffs, without stepping into a penalty box.

> WHAT A DIFFERENCE
> 
> Ranking teams by goal differential: Saskatchewan +35, Toronto +24, Colorado +7, Rochester +5, Georgia +1, Buffalo -6, Calgary -13, New England -16, Vancouver -37.

Two good points in the article - Schreiber doesn’t take penalties and ranking the teams by score differential is perhaps a good indicator of their relative performance this season. In addition the expansion draft rules are interesting:

- teams can protect 10 runners + 1 goalie or 11 runners
- teams can’t lose more players than the number of teams participating in the expansion draft (2 next year)

I am glad that USLacrosse has taken a larger interest in box lacrosse as evidenced by the increased number of box sessions at the convention and the recent Blue-White scrimmage by the men's team. Continued solid covereage like this by [USLacrosse Magazine](https://www.uslaxmagazine.com/pro/nll) is good for the sport and should help to grow the game (#GrowTheGame).

Also, kudos to Buffalo on those sharp, fresh uniforms they sported this weekend. Classic and simple - so refreshing - I think they should become permanent additions.
