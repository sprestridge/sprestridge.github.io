**King of the Mountain no more**

I was once faster than [Jim Walmsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Walmsley). It's true. But no longer. The other day I got a notification from Strava that my King of the Mountain (course record) for the South Kaibab Trail Climb had fallen by 13 seconds to [Jim Walmsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Walmsley) who is a professional-ultra-trail runner.

I was pretty sad about this as my course record on this 0.42 mile, 13% average grade climb out of the Grand Canyon along the South Kaibab Trail, had stood for 6.5 years. I set it on a short run I did for happy hour one Friday evening after spending a week in a windowless conference room at the Grand Canyon.

The King is dead, long live the King.
