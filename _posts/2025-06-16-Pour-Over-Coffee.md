### [The 4 Best Pour-Over Coffee Makers of 2025 | Reviews by Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/gear-for-making-great-coffee/)

I know. Another coffee snob writes a post about coffee but I wanted to document my current use. After being a die-hard AeroPress aficionado for years, I think I am converted to simple (ha!) pour-over. We've been using a Bean Envy pour-over carafe and a Cilio V60 style brewer. I like both. Found the following ratios interesting:

> In head-to-head tests, we kept coffee-to-water ratios and brew water temperature consistent (**1 gram of coffee for every 17 grams water, heated to 206 °F**). We also adjusted grind size, to best accommodate the flow rates for each dripper, and we landed on brew times common across multiple published recipes.

Tonx, from [YesPlz](https://www.yesplz.coffee)–our favorite coffee subscription service, was a writer for the article. It doesn’t cover technique but does provide these comments in the **How-to** section:

> But your recipe and technique also matter. The most important factors for getting consistent, delicious results are your coffee-to-water ratio, the coarseness of your grounds, the temperature of the water, and the speed of your pour.
> 
> You can find numerous recipes and guides online, but most suggest **using between a 1:15 to 1:17 ratio of coffee to water, in grams**. The coffee should be ground medium-fine (a little finer than coarse sea salt). And the water should be heated to between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit (depending on your preferences and on the coffee, with lighter or more delicate roasts preferring higher temperatures).

The 1:15 ratio is about 0.067 in decimal and 1:17 ratio about 0.059 in decimal.

This [Coffee with April video](https://youtu.be/X-fXQKqkYxI) has a small cup ratio of 0.065 (13 grams coffee to 200 grams water) and a medium of 0.067 (20 grams coffee to 300 grams water) with water temperature at 94 C (~201 F).

**Small**: 200 grams is about 7 ounces.

**Medium**: 300 grams is about 10.6 ounces.

April recommends **pours of 100 grams** at a time split between **30 grams in a circle** and **70 grams in the center**.

Their small cup is just 2 pours, while the medium is 3 pours.

I have been making my pour over with about 9 ounces (255 grams) of water from the fridge measurement, not a weighted measure. So I need to be using about **15 - 17 grams of coffee** to match these ratios. To really dial it in, a kitchen scale would be needed.

Wondering about the circle poor and center poor method employed by April? So was I. This [more recent video](https://youtu.be/PRZ-lD5si0M) from them shows three identical cups brewed with a full circle pour, a full center pour, and a 50 circle / 50 center method with the 50/50 FTW. Mind, these are flat bottom filters / brewers and I am using a V60 style brewer (the Cilio Number 2).
