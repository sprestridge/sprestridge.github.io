<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Now hosted w/ GitHub Pages. More to come soon.</p>
<p>Well, I am making these edits directly in Sublime. Not sure I understand how GitHub desktop plays into this. However, now I see. After editing in Sublime and saving, GitHub Desktop automatically sensed the change and showed it. After that I had to 'Sync' w/ the server to see the branch and the edits show up on GitHub.com. In order to publish them and see them live on the web, I will have to create a Pull Request to merge with the master branch and have this show up on the web.</p>
