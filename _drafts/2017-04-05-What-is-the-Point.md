I do not recall where I first learned of Stephanie Evergreen and her work on data visualization - I may have stumbled upon it on my own or my colleague [Robin Camarote](http://www.robincamarote.com) may have pointed me to one of Stephanie's post. Regardless, I have been following Stephanie's blog for a bit now and just read her post - [The Most Important Question in Data Visualization](http://stephanieevergreen.com/most-important-question/) which just as easily could have been titled the same as this post...'_What's your Point?_'

I ask myself this question a lot as I review presentations, final reports, and client deliverables. Unfortunately sometimes that question is not answered satisfactorily. Stephanie's post covers a situation where the client had some very good survey data, a bar graph that displayed a relevant point, and an acknowledgment that something just was not right about the current visualization.
