Recently I saw this [post on Inside Lacrosse](http://www.insidelacrosse.com/article/stringking-mark-2v-grossman-henry-huppmann-reviews/48625) reviewing the StringKing Mark 2V. I decided to write this after realizing I know and have played against Tom Huppmann (one of the reviewers, [@24sevenlax](https://www.instagram.com/24sevenlax/)) and that I had not written about or discussed the ECD Mirage launched this past fall that I got to demo ahead of the launch weekend.

## Wimmer and ECD
I was pretty excited last September when I got an email from Matt Sauri, head honcho of Wimmer Solutions -- the team I have played with in Hawaii the last two years, announcing a partnership with the guys at East Coast Dyes that would give each of our offensive players a head and some mesh to use for the  approaching Hawaii Lacrosse Invitational. East Coast Dyes was launching their first head and it was going to be officially released for purchase the weekend of the tournament. We'd be some of the first players getting to field test the production version.

A few weeks later after some emails about pocket preferences and requests not to post photos until the tournament, a shiny, newly strung ECD Mirage showed up at my door. Not only did ECD do a great job of stringing up the head to my preference but they color coordinated the entire team's heads and strung to everyone's pocket preference. See the Stringability section for a shot of all the Wimmer Mirages.

One of the first details I noticed on the head was the ECD Crab logo etched into the throat area of the head. I could not resist and immediately took a blue fine point Sharpie marker to it. I think it pops. Beyond the crab my first impressions were that the Hero mesh really strung a nice deep pocket in this head and that overall the head felt pretty light.
